# Downloading OpenImages

The original OpenImages dataset is available [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html). However, we found it might be challenging to download and process the dataset. 

Hence, we provide a direct access for our downloaded and processed OpenImages (V6) dataset.
This can enable common basline for benchmarking and reproducing the article results, and for future research.

#### Notice that when downloading and using OpenImages, one must comply with the original dataset licence, which is provided [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/factsfigures.html#:~:text=red%20indicates%20negatives.-,Licenses,-The%20annotations%20are)
